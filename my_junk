Hello, this is my_junk, which I touched on my home laptop via the terminal,
and now I'm editing it at Cloud9. I am learning to clone, add, commit, push and
pull.

It is all so very exciting.

Imagine what it would be like if I knew how to program something!

I am using Vim Mode on C9.  So far it looks like it has the Insert and Command
modes, the latter of which lets me move around the screen and do some editing.
I can do #yy, #dd, but not #p. I can move via hjkl, w and b, $ and ^, and gg and
G.
