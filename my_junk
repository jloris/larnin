Hello, this is my_junk, which I touched on my home laptop via the terminal,
and now I'm editing it at Cloud9. I am learning to clone, add, commit, push and
pull.

It is all so very exciting.

Imagine what it would be like if I knew how to program something!

I am using Vim Mode on C9.  So far it looks like it has the Insert and Command
modes, the latter of which lets me move around the screen and do some editing.
I can do #yy, #dd, but not #p. I can move via hjkl, w and b, $ and ^, and gg and
G. 

So I just tried to push the above changes (lines 1-12) and I learned about
non-fast-forward updates.  This is not a fast-forward update, because between the
time I cloned (or more generally, pulled) and the time of the push from C9, I
pushed from the local laptop terminal and updated the repo at Github to a new state.
This update would not be building directly upon its ancestor, so it is not a 
'fast-forward' update fo the repository.

GitHub -- (REPO-A)
C9 <-- clone (REPO-A)
Mac <-- clone (REPO-A)
Mac ... edit
C9 ... edit
Mac --> push (REPO-B, fast-forward of REPO-A)
C9 --> push (REPO-C, non-fast-forward of REPO-A) XXX
So...
C9 <-- pull/merge (REPO-B)
C9 ... edit conflicts
C9 --> push (REPO-C, now a fast-forward of REPO-B)


=======
I touched this file originally on my local filesystem on
RLK's laptop. Then I pushed it to the github repo, then I
pulled it to the Cloud9 clone, and I'm editing it there as
well.  What happens when I attempt to merge these two edits?

So the part above the ===== was written on C9 before and after first attempts
to edit/commit/push on C9 after editing/committing/pushing on Mac terminal.
Now I'm "fixing the conflicts", which means, I guess, editing and saving the
file as the desired version.  I'm sure there are other options.
